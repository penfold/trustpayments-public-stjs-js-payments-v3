Feature: GooglePay
  As a user
  I want to use GooglePay payment method
  In order to check full payment functionality


  Scenario Outline: GooglePay - checking payment status for <action_code> response code
    Given JS library configured by inline params GOOGLE_PAY_CONFIG and jwt BASE_JWT with additional attributes
      | key                     | value |

    And Google Pay mock responses are set as JSINIT_AUTH and payment status <action_code>
    And User opens example page
    When User chooses GOOGLE_PAY as payment method
    Then User will see notification frame text: "<payment_status_message>"
    And User will see that notification frame has "<color>" color
    And User will see following callback type called only once
      | <callback_type> |
    And submit callback contains JWT response
    And following requests were sent only once
