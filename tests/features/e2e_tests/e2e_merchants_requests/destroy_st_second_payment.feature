  Scenario Outline: Destroy ST instance and retry payment with NON_FRICTIONLESS card
    Given JS library configured by inline params BASIC_CONFIG and jwt BASE_JWT with additional attributes
      | key                     | value           |
      | requesttypedescriptions | <request_types> |
    And User opens example page
    And User fills payment form with defined card VISA_V21_NON_FRICTIONLESS

    And submit callback contains JWT response
    And submit callback contains THREEDRESPONSE: <threedresponse_defined>

    Examples:
      | request_types            | threedresponse_defined |
      | THREEDQUERY AUTH         | False                  |
