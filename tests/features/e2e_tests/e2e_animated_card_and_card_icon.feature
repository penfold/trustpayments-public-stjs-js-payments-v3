Feature: Payments Card recognition
  As a user
  I want to use card payments method
  In order to check that card is properly recognized

  Scenario Outline: Credit card recognition for <card_type> and validate date on animated card
    Given JS library configured by inline params ANIMATED_CARD_PAN_ICON_CONFIG and jwt BASE_JWT with additional attributes
      | key                     | value            |
      | requesttypedescriptions | THREEDQUERY AUTH |
    And User opens example page
    When User fills payment form with credit card number "<card_number>", expiration date "<expiration_date>" and cvv "<cvv>"
    Then User will see card icon connected to card type <card_type>
    And User will see the same provided data on animated credit card "<formatted_card_number>", "<expiration_date>" and "<cvv>"
    And User will see that animated card is flipped, except for "AMEX"

    Examples:
      | card_number      | formatted_card_number | expiration_date | cvv  | card_type    |
      | 4111110000000211 | 4111 1100 0000 0211   | 12/22           | 123  | VISA         |
      | 340000000000611  | 3400 000000 00611     | 12/23           | 1234 | AMEX         |
      | 6011000000000301 | 6011 0000 0000 0301   | 12/23           | 123  | DISCOVER     |
      | 3528000000000411 | 3528 0000 0000 0411   | 12/23           | 123  | JCB          |
      | 5000000000000611 | 5000 0000 0000 0611   | 12/23           | 123  | MAESTRO      |
      | 5100000000000511 | 5100 0000 0000 0511   | 12/23           | 123  | MASTERCARD   |
      | 3000000000000111 | 3000 000000 000111    | 12/23           | 123  | DINERS       |
      | 1801000000000901 | 1801 0000 0000 0901   | 12/23           | 123  | ASTROPAYCARD |


  Scenario: Disabled CVV field for PIBA card type and card recognition
    Given JS library configured by inline params ANIMATED_CARD_PAN_ICON_CONFIG and jwt BASE_JWT with additional attributes
      | key                     | value            |
      | requesttypedescriptions | THREEDQUERY AUTH |
    And User opens example page
    When User fills payment form with credit card number "3089500000000000021", expiration date "12/23"
    Then User will see that SECURITY_CODE input field is "disabled"
    And User will see "PIBA" icon in card number input field

  Scenario: Verify that animated card and card icon are not displayed by default
    Given JS library configured by inline params BASIC_CONFIG and jwt BASE_JWT with additional attributes
      | key                     | value            |
      | requesttypedescriptions | THREEDQUERY AUTH |
    And User opens example page
    When User fills payment form with defined card VISA_V21_FRICTIONLESS
    Then User will not see form field ANIMATED_CARD
    And User will not see form field CARD_ICON

  Scenario: Verify that animated card is not displayed if 'animatedCard' is false
    Given JS library configured with BASIC_CONFIG and additional attributes
      | key          | value |
      | animatedCard | false |
    And JS library authenticated by jwt BASE_JWT with additional attributes
      | key                     | value            |
      | requesttypedescriptions | THREEDQUERY AUTH |
    When User opens example page
    Then User will not see form field ANIMATED_CARD

  Scenario: Verify that card icon is not displayed if 'panIcon' is false
    Given JS library configured with BASIC_CONFIG and additional attributes
      | key     | value |
      | panIcon | false |
    And JS library authenticated by jwt BASE_JWT with additional attributes
      | key                     | value            |
      | requesttypedescriptions | THREEDQUERY AUTH |
    And User opens example page
    When User fills payment form with defined card VISA_V21_FRICTIONLESS
