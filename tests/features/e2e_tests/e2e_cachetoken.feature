Feature: E2E Card Payments with cachetoken
  As a user
  I want to use cachetoken from previous payment
  In order to execute payment without card data

      | key                     | value         |
      | requesttypedescriptions | CACHETOKENISE |
    And User opens example page
    When User fills payment form with defined card MASTERCARD_SUCCESSFUL_AUTH_CARD
    And User clicks Pay button
    Then User will be sent to page with url "www.example.com" having params
      | key        | value              |
      | jwt        | should not be none |
      | cachetoken | should not be none |
