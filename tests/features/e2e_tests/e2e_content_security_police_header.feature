Feature: E2E Card Payments with content-security-police header set

  As a user
  I want to use card payments method with request types config
  In order to check full payment functionality when content-security-header is set


  Scenario Outline: Successful payment with submitOnSuccess=false for VISA_FRICTIONLESS card and <request_types> request_types combination
    Given JS library configured by inline params BASIC_CONFIG and jwt BASE_JWT with additional attributes
      | key                     | value           |
      | requesttypedescriptions | <request_types> |
    And User opens minimal-content-security-header.html page with inline param
    When User fills payment form with defined card VISA_FRICTIONLESS
    And User clicks Pay button
    Then User will see payment status information: "Payment has been successfully processed"
    And User will see that notification frame has "green" color
    And User will see that Submit button is "disabled" after payment
    And User will see that ALL input fields are "disabled"

    Examples:
      | request_types            |
      | THREEDQUERY AUTH         |
      | ACCOUNTCHECK THREEDQUERY |
